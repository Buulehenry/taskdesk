            <div class="note mb-3"><strong>Plain-English summary (not a substitute for the full terms):</strong> TaskDesk is a marketplace and workflow tool that connects Clients with Freelancers and enables task posting, offers, milestones, messaging and payments. TaskDesk
                is not an employer of Freelancers. Pay through TaskDesk only. Read how ownership of Deliverables transfers after full payment, how refunds and disputes work, and how we limit liability. Uganda law governs; arbitration seated in Kampala.</div>

            <div id="acceptance" class="section mb-4">
                <h2>1) Acceptance</h2>
                <p>These Terms of Service (the <em>“Terms”</em>) form a legally binding agreement between you and TaskDesk regarding your access to and use of TaskDesk’s websites, apps, APIs and marketplace (collectively, the <em>“Service”</em>). By creating
                    an account or using the Service, you agree to these Terms and to our Privacy Notice. If you are accepting these Terms for an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization and “you” refers to it.</p>
                <p>If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="roles" class="section mb-4">
                <h2>2) About TaskDesk & Roles</h2>
                <p>TaskDesk provides a platform where registered users can post tasks, receive/submit proposals, contract, collaborate and pay for services. Unless expressly stated in a separate signed agreement, TaskDesk does not control how Freelancers
                    perform work, does not supervise or direct their services, and is not an employer, joint employer, or manager of Freelancers.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Client</strong>: a user who posts a task, milestone or project and purchases services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Freelancer</strong>: a user who offers and performs services and delivers Deliverables.</li>
                    <li><strong>Task</strong>: a scoped piece of work described by a Client; may be broken into <strong>Milestones</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Except where TaskDesk explicitly acts as a limited payments agent (Section 5), all contracts for services are directly between Clients and Freelancers (<em>“User Contracts”</em>).</p>
            </div>

            <div id="accounts" class="section mb-4">
                <h2>3) Accounts & Verification</h2>
                <h6>3.1 Eligibility</h6>
                <p>You must be at least 18 or the age of majority in your jurisdiction. Creating an account constitutes a representation that you are legally capable of entering contracts.</p>
                <h6>3.2 Registration</h6>
                <p>Provide accurate information and keep it updated. You are responsible for safeguarding credentials and for activity under your account. Enable multi‑factor authentication where available.</p>
                <h6>3.3 Verification & KYC</h6>
                <p>We may require identity, payment, address or business verification to reduce fraud, ensure compliance, enable withdrawals and raise trust. Failure to complete verification may limit access or lead to suspension.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="marketplace" class="section mb-4">
                <h2>4) Marketplace Rules</h2>
                <h6>4.1 Scoping & Proposals</h6>
                <p>Clients should provide clear task descriptions, acceptance criteria, timelines and budgets. Freelancers must submit truthful proposals and disclose material assumptions, dependencies and exclusions.</p>
                <h6>4.2 Messaging & Off‑Platform Contact</h6>
                <p>Use TaskDesk messaging for pre‑contract communications. Sharing direct contact info or moving payments off‑platform to avoid fees is prohibited (<em>non‑circumvention</em>).</p>
                <h6>4.3 Milestones & Acceptance</h6>
                <p>Clients are encouraged to break work into milestones with acceptance tests. Client has a reasonable review window after each submission to request changes or accept deliverables.</p>
                <h6>4.4 Non‑circumvention</h6>
                <p>For 24 months after first contact via TaskDesk, you agree not to circumvent TaskDesk to contract or pay the other party for substantially similar work without TaskDesk’s written consent or the applicable buy‑out fee.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="payments" class="section mb-4">
                <h2>5) Payments, Fees & Taxes</h2>
                <h6>5.1 Payments Through TaskDesk</h6>
                <p>All payments must be processed through TaskDesk using supported methods (e.g., Pesapal, Visa, Mastercard, and where available, mobile money). TaskDesk (or its payment partners) may act as limited payment collection agent for the Freelancer
                    solely to accept funds from the Client and remit to the Freelancer.</p>
                <h6>5.2 Fees</h6>
                <p>TaskDesk may charge service fees to Clients and/or Freelancers, shown at checkout or in product. Fees are subject to change prospectively.</p>
                <h6>5.3 Currency & Exchange</h6>
                <p>Prices may be displayed in UGX or other currencies. Your provider handles conversion; you are responsible for any FX charges.</p>
                <h6>5.4 Taxes</h6>
                <p>Freelancers are responsible for assessing and remitting taxes arising from their earnings. TaskDesk does not withhold taxes unless required by law.</p>
                <h6>5.5 Withholding & Offsets</h6>
                <p>We may withhold or offset amounts if we believe transactions are fraudulent, violate law or these Terms, or are subject to chargeback or refund.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="deliverables" class="section mb-4">
                <h2>6) Deliverables, IP & Licensing</h2>
                <h6>6.1 Ownership Transfer</h6>
                <p>Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing: upon full payment of all amounts due for a Task or Milestone, the Freelancer assigns to the Client all right, title and interest in the Deliverables (excluding Freelancer Tools defined below).
                    Before payment, Freelancer grants Client a limited, revocable license to review solely for acceptance testing.</p>
                <h6>6.2 Freelancer Tools</h6>
                <p>Freelancer retains ownership of pre‑existing materials, know‑how, methods, code libraries, and tools used to create Deliverables (<em>“Freelancer Tools”</em>). Freelancer grants Client a perpetual, worldwide, royalty‑free license to use
                    Freelancer Tools embedded in Deliverables to the extent necessary to use the Deliverables.</p>
                <h6>6.3 Third‑Party Components</h6>
                <p>Deliverables may include third‑party components (e.g., open‑source libraries, stock assets) subject to their licenses, which will control in case of conflict.</p>
                <h6>6.4 Moral Rights & Portfolio Use</h6>
                <p>Freelancer waives or agrees not to enforce moral rights to the extent permitted by law and may reference non‑confidential Deliverables in a portfolio, unless the Client’s contract or NDA prohibits it.</p>
